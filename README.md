# Docker Case Study

## Introduction

Docker is an open source software platform that simplifies building, running and managing applications.<br>
By packaging software into standardized executable containers, Docker applications are independent of the host Operating system and can run in any environment.


## Brief History

Docker Inc. was founded in 2010 during the Summer Y Combinator startup incubator group and launched in 2011.<br>
In 2013 Docker had its public debut in Santa Clara at PyCon, and was released as open source in March 2013.

#### Major Milestones

- **September 19, 2013:**<br> Red Hat and Docker announce a collaboration around Red Hat's linux distributions and Red Hat's own containerization product OpenShift.
-  **October 15, 2014:**<br> Microsoft announces support for integration of the Docker engine into Windows Server, and native support for Docker client in Windows.
-  **December 2015:**<br> Oracle Cloud adds support for Docker containers.
-  **May 2016:**<br> Docker project analysis showed the following organizations as main contributors to Docker: The Docker team, Cisco, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, and Red Hat.
- **January 2017:**<br> An analysis of LinkedIn profile mentions showed a rapid adoption rate with 160% growth in 2016.
- **August 2020:**<br> Microsoft announces support for Docker on Windows 10 versions 1903 and 1909 running WSL. By now Docker is supported on all major Windows versions including Home.

## Features

Docker software consists of three components:

- **Software:** The Docker daemon, or service. A persistent process that manages Docker containers. And Docker client that provides CLI to interact with Docker daemon.
- **Objects:** Used to assemble an application in Docker. Like images, containers and services.
- **Registries:** Repositories for images. Images are read-only templates for building containers. Docker client connects to registry to download images for use, or upload built images.

#### Fast and easy configuration and deployment
Docker containers allow a developer to package an application with all the parts it needs to run independently from the host Operating system, and deploy anywhere.

#### Application isolation
Docker containers run applications in an isolated environment where each container is independent and can execute any kind of application.

#### Docker Hub repository
Docker Hub is the world's largest public repository for container images. Including community developers and open source projects.


## Strengths

#### Cloud Platform support
All major cloud computing providers have individual support for Docker. This includes Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Platform. 

#### Continuous integration efficiency
The same container image can be used in every step of the deployment process, speeding up the time it takes to go from build to production.
