# Docker Case Study

<br />

## Introduction

Docker is an open source software platform that simplifies building, running and managing applications.<br>
By packaging software into standardized executable containers, Docker applications are independent of the host Operating system and can run in any environment.


## Brief History

Docker Inc. was founded in 2010 during the Summer Y Combinator startup incubator group and launched in 2011.<br>
In 2013 Docker had its public debut in Santa Clara at PyCon, and was released as open source in March 2013.
