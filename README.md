# Docker Case Study

<br />

## Introduction

Docker is an open source software platform that simplifies building, running and managing applications.<br>
By packaging software into portable containers, Docker applications are independent of the host Operating system.

In 2013 Docker had its public debut in Santa Clara at PyCon, and was released as open source in March 2013.
